    "2. How to use the created policy with `ApplyGuardrail` API for Bedrock. We tested different policy configurations for different text and image content.\n",
    "3. How to use the guardrail configuration for `Converse` API for Bedrock. We tested how to attach a guardrail configuration in the request for `Converse` API. We also learned how to apply guardrails to only selective request portion. And lastly, we learned how to enforce the application of guardrails with Bedrock's `Converse` API."
