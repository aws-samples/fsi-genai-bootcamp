    "# Retrieval Augmented Question & Answering with Amazon Bedrock using LangChain & Vector Search\n",
    "> *This notebook should work well with the **`Data Science 3.0`** kernel in SageMaker Studio*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we used the Anthropic Claude model in Amazon Bedrock to demonstrate a basic Question Answering (QA) system, and learned the value of grounding a model with additional context before generating a response. In the previous notebook, we had to manually provide the model with relevant data and context ourselves. However, this approach is not fit for enterprise-level QA systems where there could be hundreds of thousands of large documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can improve upon this process by implementing an architecture called retrieval augmented generation (RAG). RAG retrieves data from outside the LLM's training data sources and augments the prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data as context. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, without needing to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we augment LLM responses to user queries by implementing RAG using context from external documents. First, we process documents and store these into a vector store. Next, we search the vector store using the user's question, and return relevant data as external context to the LLM. Finally, the LLM generates an answer to the user's question based on the new context provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk through implementing the following two patterns: Question Answering (QA) and Conversational AI with conversation memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down the solution a little further. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare documents for search\n",
    "![Documents](./images/embeddings_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the documents must be processed and then indexed in a vector store.\n",
    "- Load the documents from our directory\n",
    "- Process the documents by splitting them into smaller chunks\n",
    "- Create a numerical vector representation of each chunk using an embeddings model\n",
    "- Create an index using the chunks and the corresponding embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Respond to the user’s question\n",
    "![Question](./images/chatbot_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the vector store is indexed with documents and embeddings, we can search for text relevant to the question being asked. The relevant chunks are sent to the model as additional context, where the model will then generate the answer.\n",
    "- Create an embedding of the input question\n",
    "- Compare the question embedding with the embeddings in the index\n",
    "- Fetch the (top N) relevant document chunks\n",
    "- Add those chunks as part of the context in the prompt\n",
    "- Send the prompt to the model under Amazon Bedrock\n",

    "However, this could lead to suboptimal results if the most relevant information we are looking for is split across multiple pages. Instead, we will split the documents into sections based on the documents own table of contents. The implementation for this approach is provided in the rag_utils.outline_parser module [(source)](./rag_utils/outline_parser.py).\n",
    "Note that this approach only works on PDFs that contain a table of contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parent Document Retriever\n",
    "After we've loaded the document as individual sections, we will further split these sections by paragraphs using the [RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/recursive_text_splitter/). These are the chunks that will be used for embeddings, however during retrieval we'll utilize the [ParentDocumentRetriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/parent_document_retriever/) to retrieve the entire section that the chunk belongs to. This is done to ensure that the context provided to the model is as complete as possible.\n"

    "The example provides a naive implementation of RAG. While it works for demonstration purposes, it has a number of limitations:\n",
    "- The are no guardrails in place to ensure that the model does not engage in any topics other than model risk and governance\n",
    "- The user's question may not be the most optimal search query for the vector store.\n",
    "- The workflow is stateless and not conversational. User is not able to ask follow up questions\n",
    "- Retrieval is based purely on semantic similarity. There is no filtering or ranking of the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll address these limitations by introducing a few more components to our workflow.\n",
    "- [**LangGraph**](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph): A python library for building custom LLM and Agent based workflows. LangGraph allows us to express a workflow as a finite state machine (FSM) making it possible to orchestrate LLM driven steps, hardcoded logic, and human input in the loop workflows.\n",
    "- [**BM25 Retrieval**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retrievers/bm25/): A retrieval method that uses a probabilistic model to rank documents based on their relevance to a query. BM25 is a popular choice for information retrieval tasks and can be used as a complement to semantic search methods.\n",
    "- [**Hybrid Retrieval**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/ensemble_retriever/): Will combine the BM25 and FAISS retrievers to provide a more robust retrieval method.\n",
    "- [**Amazon Reran Model**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/rerank.html): A model that can be used to re-rank the retrieved documents based on their relevance to the query. This will help us filter out any irrelevant documents and improve the quality of the context provided to the LLM.\n",
    "- [**Bedrock Session API**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/sessions.html): A new API that allows us to maintain a session with the LLM. This will help us maintain conversation state and allow for follow up questions."

    "- Loading documents and processing them into smaller chunks\n",
    "- Creating a vector store using FAISS\n",
    "- Generating embeddings with an embeddings model\n",
    "- Searching the vector store to retrieve context relevant to the question\n",
    "- Performing Generative Question Answering using foundation models\n",
    "- Improving trust in our system by providing citations with every answer\n",
    "- Preparing prompt templates to use as input to the LLM\n",
    "- Storing conversation memory and providing the history as context to the LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next steps\n",
    "- Experiment with different vector stores\n",
    "- Leverage various text and embedding models available through Amazon Bedrock to see alternate outputs\n",
    "- Explore options such as persistent storage of embeddings and document chunks\n",
