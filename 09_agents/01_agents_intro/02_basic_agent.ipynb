    "In this notebook, we will introduce the concept of AI agents and how they can be used to solve problems. Unlike static LLM workflows, AI agents are dynamic and can adapt to a much wider range of problems. They are particularly well suited when we don't know the exact parameters of each user interaction. Some cases which may call for AI agents include:\n",
    "- Goal oriented tasks such as researching a topic, analyzing data across many sources, or helping find the best product for a user.\n",
    "- Tasks that may involve a wide variety of user inputs, such as document processing where there may be a wide variety of document formats and data that needs to be extracted.\n",
    "- Tasks that may involve usage of various external tools or APIs, without a fixed sequential order of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous frameworks available for implementing agents including [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/), [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/), and [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph). The frameworks vary in their capabilities and complexity, but all provide a way to define and deploy agents that can interact with users and other systems.For this notebook, we will use a lightweight framework from Hugging Face called [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents). This framework provides a very simple and lightweight way to define agents that can interact with users and other systems, and is thus well suitable for quick prototyping and experimentation.\n",

    "## Simple Search Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a simple search agent that can search for information on the web. The agent will take a query from the user and return the top search results. We will use DuckDuckGo as the search engine for this agent.\n",
    "smolagents offers two types of agents:\n",
    "- [CodeAgent](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.01030): Invokes tools via generated python code snippets. This provides flexibility in terms of how the agent interacts with external tools as it's able to expand on the capabilities of the tools by incorporating custom code.\n",
    "- [ToolCallingAgent](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit2/smolagents/tool_calling_agents): Invokes tools by generating a JSON output that contains the tool name and parameters and the invocation parameters. This approach is more rigid as the model is limited to the capabilities of the tools it calls however it may prove to be more efficient and secure in some cases as it does not involve running arbitrary code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As as an example if we have a tool that can reterieve stock data for a given stock symbol. If the agent receives a task that involves retrieving stock data for say \"AAPL\", \"MSFT\" and \"GOOGL\", the CodeAgent will write a code snippet with a simple for loop that will retrieve the stock data for each symbol. While the ToolCallingAgent will generate a JSON output that contains the tool name and parameters and the invocation parameters for each stock symbol. Additionally, if the tasks requires invoking additional tools to analyze the stock data, the CodeAgent can potentially tackle this in a single code snippet, while the ToolCallingAgent will need to make multiple calls to the tools which could be less efficient."

    "## Stock Analysis Agent\n",
    "Let's look at a more complex example. We will build an agent that can analyze stock data. In addition to web search, this agent will have access to the following tools:\n",
    "- `get_ticker_data`: This tool will retrieve stock data for a given stock symbol.\n",
    "- `get_fred_data`: This tool will retrieve economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API.\n",
    "- `run_ols_regression`: This tool will run an ordinary least squares regression which can be used to analyze the relationship between two variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining tools is easy as we merely need to decorate a function with the `@tool` decorator. The function should contain a docstring in [Google-style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) format that describes the tool's inputs and outputs. Providing clear documentation is important as it informs the agent about the tool's capabilities and how to use it."
