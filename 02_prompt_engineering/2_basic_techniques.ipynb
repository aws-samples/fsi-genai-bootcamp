    "About Moody's Bank ScorecardOur Bank Scorecard is designed to capture, express and explain in summary form our Rating Committee's judgment. When read in conjunction with our research, a fulsome presentation of our judgment is expressed. As a result, the output of our Scorecard may materially differ from that suggested by raw data alone (though it has been calibrated to avoid the frequent need for strong divergence). The Scorecard output and the individual scores are discussed in rating committees and may be adjusted up or down to reflect conditions specific to each rated entity. As per Moody's Banks rating methodology, the historic ratios in the scorecard for Capital are as of most recent period, for Asset Risk and Profitability they are the worse of the most recent year-to-date period or the average of the last three years and the most recent year-to-date, and for Funding Structure and Liquid Resources they are as of the most recent year-end.\n",
    "2. RATINGS:\n",
    "Please see the ratings section at the end of this report for more information. The ratings and outlook shown reflect information as of the publication date. \n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "Bank of America Corporation (BAC, A1 stable) is the parent holding company for the second largest banking group in the US. The group is a global systemically important bank operating primarily through its principal bank subsidiary, Bank of America N.A. (BANA, Aa1 stable, a2 baseline credit assessment). BAC's credit profile is supported by its conservative risk appetite, a balanced and diversified business mix, strong funding and liquidity, robust cost discipline, strengthened capital and resilient profitability. During 2022, in response to increases in its regulatory capital requirements, BAC boosted its capital ratios significantly.\n",
