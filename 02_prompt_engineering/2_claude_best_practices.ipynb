Claude can take up to 200,000 tokens in each prompt, meaning it can work over hundreds of pages of text, or even an entire book. Claude 2 can also write longer documents—on the order of a few thousand tokens—compared to its prior version, giving you even greater ways to develop generative AI applications using Amazon Bedrock.\n",

With its 200,000 token context window, which is equivalent to about 200 pages of information, Claude lets you process large amounts of data in a single prompt. As a result, you can use documents, emails, FAQs, chat transcripts or even entire codebases as inputs for Claude to edit, rewrite, summarize, answer questions, generate code, and more."
